# PHP Utility Classes

Work in progress at this point. These are classes that I've copied and pasted and modified in various projects. Trying to abstract out things that are site specific, so they can be used generally.

## Update 2015-02-14
I've just touched the surface, but am rendering a basic, compliant HTML page. To run the demo:

1. You need [PHP](http://php.net/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), and [Bower](http://bower.io/). Install these.
2. Download this repo (unzip, cd into)
3. cd into demo. demo will probably soon be a separate repository, it's convenient for me to have it all in one directory, but many complications and benefits point toward moving it. Anyway ...

4. $ composer update
5. $ bower install
6. $ php -S localhost:8000
7. Go to [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) in your browser
8. win
